# hand-gesture-volume-control
Control your system volume using hand gestures with OpenCV and MediaPipe.
# Hand Gesture Volume Control 🎛️✋

Control your system volume using simple hand gestures — no need to touch your keyboard!

## 🧠 About the Project
This project uses your **webcam** to detect hand gestures (thumb and index finger) using **MediaPipe**, and adjusts the **system volume** in real-time using **PyCaw**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- 🧿 OpenCV – for image capture and rendering
- 🖐️ MediaPipe – for real-time hand landmark detection
- 🔊 PyCaw – for controlling system volume
- 🐍 Python – for implementation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw numpy
